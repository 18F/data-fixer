# 10x datafixer prototype

This repository contains the UI prototype for Phase 2 of the (10x)[https://10x.gsa.gov/] "Data Fixer" tool.

The original 10x pitch text:

    Data practitioners are often faced with incorrectly-formatted data for fields that have known formats, such as zip code or social security number. TTS will explore using machine learning to extend the 10x U.S. Data Federation's ReVal tool (or to create a new tool) capable of not only validating data, but proposing fixes when such formatting errors are identified, which could result in much quicker data repair, saving time and effort for practitioners. - the U.S. Data Federation, Data Fixer Author
