# Jupyter notebooks

This package is a collection of Jupyter notebooks. The purpose of the notebooks are to do data exploration, and test out various ways of working with data.

Longer-term, one future development direction might involve exposing datafixer libraries to end-users via hosted Jupyter notebooks. As a result, these notebooks also serve the purpose of exploring ways that could be achieved.

## Usage

```bash
yarn bazel run //notebooks:launch
```
